      <description>The mission of OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyse and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.

      <title>Mapping 1.5 to 2.0</title>

      <description>Overview For those organizations using 1.0 or 1.5 versions of SAMM it&amp;rsquo;s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved. Organizations that implemented security initiatives and are looking for SAMM scores to validate effectiveness will need to take these changes into consideration since in most cases expectations for maturity level 3 have been significantly increased in favor of automation and better alignment with development teams.</description>

      <description>The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. SAMM helps you:
 Evaluate an organizationâ€™s existing software security practices Build a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance program Define and measure security-related activities throughout an organization  SAMM 1.</description>
