<h1 id="short-description">Short Description</h1>

<p>This practice forms the basis of your secure software activities by building an overall plan.</p>

<h1 id="long-description">Long Description</h1>

<p>Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counter-productive. The goal of this security practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization.</p>

<p>A software security program, that selects and prioritizes activities of the rest of the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts. The practice works on building the plan, maintaining and disseminating it.</p>

<p>At the same time, you want to keep track of your security posture and program improvements. A metrics-driven approach is included to ensure an accurate view on your activities. To measure is to know.</p>

<h3 id="benefit">Benefit</h3>

<p>Have a common understanding of an application security baseline.</p>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>Understand, based on application risk exposure, what threats exist or may exist, as well as how tolerant executive leadership is of these risks. This understanding is a key component of determining software security assurance priorities. To ascertain these threats, interview business owners and stakeholders and document drivers specific to industries where the organization operates as well as drivers specific to the organization. Gathered information includes worst-case scenarios that could impact the organization, as well as opportunities where an optimized software development life-cycle and more secure applications could provide a market-differentiator or create additional opportunities.</p>

<p>Gathered information provides a baseline for  the organization to develop and promote its application security program. Items in the program are prioritized to address threats and opportunities most important to the organization. The baseline is split into several risk factors and drivers linked directly to the organization’s priorities and used to help build a risk profile of each custom-developed application by documenting how they can impact the organization if they are compromised.</p>

<p>The baseline and individual risk factors should be published and made available to application development teams to ensure a more transparent process of creating application risk profiles and incorporating the organization’s priorities into the program. Additionally, these goals should provide a set of objectives which should be used to ensure all application security program enhancements provide direct support of the organization’s current and future needs.</p>

should also include organizational perspective + link to business priorities and regulatory compliance
The goal here is to promote the metrics as well as the application security program.

**Summit MN**:
* identify objectives, not drivers
* some of the writing is linked to rather to business than to applications -> talk about organization/business risk rather than application risk
* link betwwen application risk profile (design -> threat assessnent) and this level should be made
* baseline = minimal set of requirements which all aplications within the organization have to meet
* It might be better to work with risk drivers rather than threats (is it sensibvle to start rather positively?) - maybe add sth like "depending on your culture" or put it in the implementation guidance

<h2 id="maturity-2">Maturity 2</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-1">Benefit</h3>

<p>Have an aligned plan and roadmap within the organization.</p>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>Based on the magnitude of assets, threats, and risk tolerance, develop a security strategic plan and budget to address business priorities around application security. The plan covers 1 to 3 years and includes milestones consistent with the organization’s business drivers and risks. It provides tactical and strategic initiatives and follows a roadmap that makes its alignment with business priorities and needs visible.</p>

<p>In the roadmap reach a balance between changes requiring financial expenditures, changes of processes and procedures, and changes impacting the organization’s culture. This balance helps accomplish multiple milestones concurrently and without overloading or exhausting available resources or development teams. The milestones are frequent enough to help monitor program success and trigger timely roadmap adjustments.</p>

<p>For the program to be successful, the application security team obtains buy-in from the organization’s stakeholders and application development teams. A published plan is available to anyone who is required to support or participate in its implementation.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-3">Maturity 3</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-2">Benefit</h3>

<p>Continuous improvement of your application security efforts.</p>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity</h3>

<p>You review the application security plan periodically for ongoing applicability and support of the organization’s evolving needs and future growth. To do this, you repeat the steps from the first two maturity levels of this Security Practice at least annually. The goal is for the plan to always support the current and future needs of the organization, which ensures the program is aligned with the business.</p>

<p>In addition to reviewing the business drivers, the organization closely monitors the success of the implementation of each of the roadmap milestones. You evaluate the success of the milestones based on a wide range of criteria, including completeness and efficiency of the implementation, budget considerations, and any cultural impacts or changes resulting from the initiative. You review missed or unsatisfactory milestones and evaluate possible changes to the overall program.</p>

<p>The organization develops dashboards and measurements for management and teams responsible for software development to monitor the implementation of the roadmap. These dashboards are detailed enough to identify individual projects and initiatives and provide a clear understanding of whether the program is successful and aligned with the organization’s needs.</p>

<h1 id="b-measure-and-improve">B: Measure and Improve</h1>

<h2 id="maturity-1-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-3">Benefit</h3>

<p>Have a set of base metrics to provide insight into software security.</p>

<h3 id="activity-3">Activity</h3>

<p>Define and document metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the application security program. This way improvements are measurable and you can use them to secure future support and funding for the program. Considering the dynamic nature of most development environments, metrics should be comprised of measurements in the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Effort</code> metrics measure the effort spent on security. For example training hours, time spent performing code reviews, and number of applications scanned for vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><code>Result</code> metrics measure the results of security efforts. Examples include number of unpatched security defects and number of security incidents involving application vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><code>Environment</code> metrics measure the environment where security efforts take place. Examples include number of applications or lines of code as a measure of difficulty or complexity.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Each measure by itself is useful for a specific purpose, but a combination of two or three metrics together helps explain spikes in metrics trends. For example, a spike in a total number of vulnerabilities may be caused by the organization on-boarding several new applications that have not been previously exposed to the implemented application security mechanisms. Alternatively, an increase in the environment metrics without a corresponding increase in the effort or result could be an indicator of a mature and efficient security program.</p>

<p>While identifying metrics, it’s always recommended to stick to the metrics that meet several criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistently Measured</li>
<li>Inexpensive to gather</li>
<li>Expressed as a cardinal number or a percentage</li>
<li>Expressed as a unit of measure</li>
</ul>

<p>Document metrics and include descriptions of best and most efficient methods for gathering data, as well as recommended methods for combining individual measures into meaningful metrics. For example, a number of applications and a total number of defects across all applications may not be useful by themselves but, when combined as a number of outstanding high-severity defects per application, they provide a more actionable metric.</p>

Assets is to be interpreted broader than the software only.

We should make sure that we address metrics from the stand point of:
- Metrics to measure the maturity of each BF and SP
- Non-Defect related metrics that measure activities such as training, threat assessments, etc
- Defect-related such as bugs / issues / etc

We should make sure to reference all other Security Practices and activities within the model, such as Implementation Defect Tracking metrics

**Summit MN:**
* decrease of number of vulnerabilites is 2nd order metrics, focus on 1st level metrics
* number of base metrics and deduced metrics -> might be sensible to mention it
* we can call the metrics from defect tracking as an example
* "result" is a better word rather than "impact" (just stressing the fact)
* "most efficient matter for gathering data" -> mention that you can gather data in a manual or automated (preferred) way
* "Expressed as a unit of measure" -> units should be the ones people care about ("covered lines of code" not a good example)
* CMMI levels not very recognizeable in the description of all levels (Best effort / Process and alignment / Improving and measuring)
* we don't mention that one of the metrics is budget spent
* what are the drivers for definition of a particular metric? Which metrics are useful? Should we measure anything we can or not? Some ground should be laid in the practice description
* measuring SAMM Maturity as an example as well?
* discussion on inexpensive vs expensive metrics - cost/benefit? or just cost e.g. in term of hours?
* Maybe some of the metrics to be put on level 2? bar too high?
* discussion about coverage? where to start? (probably rather easy)
* measurement and risk mgmt? Should there be more of it? - no decision

<p>A set of concrete objectives has been established to guide your improvement efforts</p>

<h3 id="activity-4">Activity</h3>

<p>Once the organization has defined its application security metrics, collect enough information to establish realistic goals. Test identified metrics to ensure you can gather data consistently and efficiently over a short period. After the initial testing period, the organization should have enough information to commit to goals and objectives expressed through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).</p>

<p>While several measurements are useful for monitoring the information security program and its effectiveness, KPIs are comprised of the most meaningful and effective metrics. Aim to remove volatility common in application development environments from KPIs to reduce chances of unfavorable numbers resulting from temporary or misleading individual measurements. Base KPIs on metrics considered valuable not only to Information Security professionals but also to individuals responsible for the overall success of the application, and organization’s leadership. View KPIs as definitive indicators of the success of the whole program and consider them actionable.</p>

<p>Fully document KPIs and distribute them to the teams contributing to the success of the program as well as organization’s leadership. Ideally, include a brief explanation of the information sources for each KPI and the meaning if the numbers are high or low. Include short and long-term goals, and ranges for unacceptable measurements requiring immediate intervention. Share action plans with application security and application development teams to ensure full transparency in understanding of the organization’s objectives and goals.</p>

<p>Your application security program is fundamentally driven by objective measures and concrete goals.</p>

<h3 id="activity-5">Activity</h3>

<p>Define guidelines for influencing the Application Security program based on the KPIs and other application security metrics. These guidelines  combine the maturity of the application development process and procedures  with different metrics to make the program more efficient. The following examples show a relationship between measurements and ways of evolving and improving application security:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focus on maturity of the development life-cycle makes the relative cost per defect lower by applying security proactively.</li>
<li>Monitoring the balance between effort, result, and environment metrics improves the program’s efficiency and justifies additional automation and other methods for improving the overall application security baselines.</li>
<li>Individual Security Practices could provide indicators of success or failure of individual application security initiatives.</li>
<li>Effort metrics helps ensure application security work is directed at the more relevant and important technologies and disciplines.</li>
</ul>

<p>When defining the overall metrics strategy, keep the end-goal in mind and define what decisions can be made as a result of changes in KPIs and metrics as soon as possible, to help guide development of metrics.</p>
