      <description>The mission of OWASP SAMM is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyse and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.
The original model (v1.0) was written by Pravir Chandra and dates back from 2009.</description>

      <description>The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. SAMM helps you:
 Evaluate an organizationâ€™s existing software security practices Build a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance program Define and measure security-related activities throughout an organization  SAMM 1.</description>
